This is a RPG type of game made as an assigment for the
"Object-Oriented Programming" class. In this project I
used various methodologies regarding object-oriented
programming, such as inheritance, encapsulation and
polymorphism. I also used the Singleton Pattern for
the Game and Grid classes (since there should be just
one object for each class), Visitor Pattern for 
applying spells on different entities and Factory
Pattern for creating the characters.
