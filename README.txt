This is a RPG-type game made as an assignment for the
"Object-Oriented Programming" class. In this project I
used various methodologies regarding object-oriented
programming, such as inheritance, encapsulation and
polymorphism. I also used the Singleton Pattern for
the Game and Grid classes (since there should be just
one object for each class), the Visitor Pattern for 
applying spells to different entities and the Factory
Pattern for creating the characters.
